## Summary
I am a System Engineering student at La Universidad de Los Andes (Venezuela) and Computer Science student at Universidad
Nacional de Colombia. I love to solve math-algorithmic interesting problems while learning new techniques and
concepts to improve my problem solving skills. I have a good background on algorithms and mathematics thanks to
extracurricular studying and active participation on programming competitions. I also enjoy working on challenger projects, 
that help me to over pass my skill limits.
